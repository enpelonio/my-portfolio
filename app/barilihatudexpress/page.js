            <p className="font-body">
              Residents of Barili, Cebu face challenges accessing essential services like food delivery, grocery shopping, and ride requests, especially busy families, elderly residents, and individuals living far from the marketplace. Limited local options for such services create inconveniences and time constraints, reducing access to essential goods and transportation, particularly for those with mobility or connectivity challenges.
              Furthermore, motorcycle drivers have limited access to passengers because the passengers they can take is only limited to their own barangay residents. They have a lot of idle time and competition with the only service they can provide being the ride service.
